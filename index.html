      <p>One thing I would like to bring attention to is that I added a Favicon for this site and made sure to use JavaScript to display a mobile friendly version of the "Music" webpage depending on the inner width of the user's screen. The effect of this script can also be observed when switching the device view in the browser's inspector tab as well. I like to develop keeping the inspector tab open which allows me to track any messages that are logged to the console which is very helpful for debugging.</p>

      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p id="one" onmouseover="bigImg1()" onmouseout="normalImg1()">Before I was severely injured I was a technical consultant for a managed services company in Denver and was the cofounder of a web design startup in Denver called the Brink Media Company. During my recovery I taught myself many web design and web development skills, such as Node.js and the Vue.js web framework. I am explicitly a JavaScript developer but have only ever built Express apps with EJS and am excited to learn Handlebars.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p id="two" onmouseover="bigImg2()" onmouseout="normalImg2()">I have lived in Colorado since I was three. I grew up in Colorado Springs. When I was 19 I went to DU and got my Bachelor's Degree with a double major in Video Production and English. Before my accident I was living in Denver, but for the time being I am living in Colorado Springs again.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p id="three" onmouseover="bigImg3()" onmouseout="normalImg3()">I like to develop web pages at coffee shops, hike in the mountains, bike, hang out with my pet hedgehog, and volunteer at nonprofits.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p id="four" onmouseover="bigImg4()" onmouseout="normalImg4()">My dream is to found a nonprofit coffee shop called the Reawaken Foundation where we employ traumatic brain injury survivors and offer web design and web development services to other businesses.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p id="five" onmouseover="bigImg5()" onmouseout="normalImg5()">Right now I may live in Colorado Springs, but I hope to get a software development job and move back to Denver, to Boulder, or Broomfield because of the numerous tech companies out there.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p id="six" onmouseover="bigImg6()" onmouseout="normalImg6()">I want to become a web developer to aid in the creation of my nonprofit and because I think that the inherent nature of the world wide web fosters a culture of comunication and connection. I would like to be able to help facilitate this communication and connectivity by becoming a web developer. As one of my friends put it, I am a transhumanist, meaning that I believe that humanity is further aided by technology and is thusly made more beneficially connected.</p>
